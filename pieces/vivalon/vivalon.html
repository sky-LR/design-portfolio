                    <h3>Physical Products with Vivalon</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my internship with Vivalon, a senior care nonprofit, I managed a project designing vinyl car wraps for their meal delivery and rideshare services dedicated to seniors and individuals with disabilities.
                        Collaborating with the client, including feedback from the CEO, aimed at creating a design aligning with Vivalon's commitment to providing seniors with a vibrant and active life.
                        Beyond aesthetics, the challenge was to infuse the design with a sense of movement, embodying the dynamic lifestyle that sets Vivalon apart.
